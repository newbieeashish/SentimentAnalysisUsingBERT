### SentimentAnalysisUsingBERT

#### Description of Dataset
#### IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics. This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. It consists of a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. So,we have to predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.So here we will use BERT and train it for classifying reviews as positive/negative correctly.
